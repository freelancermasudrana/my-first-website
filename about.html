                    <p>My story began when I was a boy. At a young age, I experienced the instability of my mother’s bipolar sickness and alcoholism. She couldn’t take care of herself, let alone her children, so I grew up without much of my mother’s presence and care.</p>
                    <p>Not having the love and nourishment that a mother gives to a child during their upbringing created a deep trauma in my being, and a skewed relationship with the Feminine in general.</p>
                    <p>I didn’t know how to interact with girls, and I was detached from my sexuality. This deep-seated blockage caused me to fall into an intense and extensive period of loneliness, where I struggled to hold intimate relationships for several years.</p>

                <p>During my first relationship, I felt like I was walking on clouds. It was the best feeling in the world, but as the saying goes, love is blind. I believed it was real love; it was merely an attachment. In hindsight, I wanted to fill my lack of feminine nourishment through sex and female attention. Essentially, feeling good about myself became an addiction.</p>
                <p>It was an extremely rocky relationship, since I couldn’t make myself available to her emotionally. And looking back, it’s no wonder that I wasn’t able to do it; I never learned how to feel emotions, or how to use my emotions skillfully to get close to myself and another human being. As a child, I had learned to suppress them in order to survive.</p>

                    <p>Around the same time, my best friend suddenly died in his early twenties from an accident. He was my neighbour, and we were the same age. We’d connected through sharing the same mission of self-development, so it’s obvious to say that this incident had a deep impact on me. But at the same time, it served as a catalyst to a personal spiritual awakening. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could witness my own thoughts and mind. It was as though I was separated from them, and <br> time became slower, colors became more crisp, and my vision became clearer.</p>
                    <p>That awakening helped me become more aligned with my intuition. My heart’s yearning said “there has to be more to life,” and I knew I had to follow the call to set out on an adventure to seek the truth.</p>

                    <p>My desire to get more out of life led me to one of the biggest risks that I had ever taken up until that point in my life. I got rid of my apartment, stored my belongings in boxes, sold my car, and set out on a solo pilgrimage trip around the world.</p>
                    <p>In the Hero’s Journey, this stage is often represented by an ordeal or a challenge, or what ancient cultures called a “walkabout,” or vision quest.</p>

                    <p>My own version of the second stage started with a single one-way flight ticket in my hand. With my backpack on my shoulders, and a broken heart inside of me, I began my search for answers. This was, in effect, my quest to heal and transform my life.</p>

                    <p>After years of traveling, I visited more than 21 countries, and spent over $75k, but I had finally found what I was looking for.</p>
